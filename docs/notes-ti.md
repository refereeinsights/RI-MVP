## 2026-02-19
- TI tournament detail access-tier update (paid planning fields):
  - Added a new **Premium Planning Details** section to `apps/ti-web/app/tournaments/[slug]/page.tsx` with a lock state for non-paid users.
  - Locked (public + free-login) behavior now shows:
    - "Locked — Upgrade to view Food vendors, restrooms, amenities, travel/lodging notes."
    - Upgrade CTA linking to `/pricing`.
  - Paid behavior now conditionally fetches and renders:
    - `tournaments.travel_lodging` (display label: "Travel/Lodging Notes")
    - `venues.food_vendors`
    - `venues.restrooms`
    - `venues.amenities`
  - Public/base detail query remains on `tournaments_public` and does not expose premium planning fields.
  - Added styling for the premium card in `apps/ti-web/app/tournaments/tournaments.css`.
  - Temporary entitlement stub added:
    - `TI_FORCE_PAID_TOURNAMENT_DETAILS=true` enables paid rendering path.
  - Validation:
    - `npx tsc -p apps/ti-web/tsconfig.json --noEmit` passed.
    - `next lint` for `ti-web` still requires initial ESLint setup prompt in this workspace.

## 2026-02-18
- Tournament directory summary tile updates:
  - Total tournaments tile now shows current on-page result count (post-filter), not global DB total:
    - `apps/ti-web/app/tournaments/page.tsx`.
  - Total tile icon switched to transparent TI mark:
    - `/svg/ti/tournamentinsights_mark_transparent.svg`.
  - Added new shared asset:
    - `shared-assets/svg/ti/tournamentinsights_mark_transparent.svg`.
  - Cropped transparent mark viewBox so the icon appears visually larger/centered in the tile.
  - Increased summary/tournament sport SVG icon sizes for better lacrosse visibility:
    - `apps/ti-web/app/tournaments/tournaments.css`.
- Homepage messaging update:
  - Committed `ed9cb02` (`TI: update homepage value props copy`) in `apps/ti-web/app/page.tsx`.
  - Replaced “What TournamentInsights provides” block copy with current value-prop language:
    - Verified tournament essentials — sport, dates, location, and official links
    - Clean filtering by sport, state, and month
    - Structured, moderated event insights
    - Logistics-focused detail pages built for real tournament planning
  - Replaced follow-up paragraph with:
    - “TournamentInsights delivers organized, moderated tournament intelligence designed to help families, coaches, and teams evaluate events faster and with greater confidence.”
  - Removed homepage defensive wording around “no ratings / no public reviews / not a review platform”.
- Homepage layout polish:
  - Center-aligned the “What TournamentInsights Provides” heading and bullet content (scoped styling only).
  - Files:
    - `apps/ti-web/app/page.tsx`
    - `apps/ti-web/app/globals.css`

## 2026-02-16
- TI branding: TI header/layout mirrors RI structure with TI colors and shared logo `shared-assets/svg/ti/tournamentinsights_logo.svg` (used in layout/home).
- TI pages: Added `/tournaments` (RI-style filters/cards, no ratings/reviews), `/tournaments/[slug]` (logistics-only detail), `/how-it-works`, `/list-your-tournament`, and updated home CTAs.
- Assets/infra: Copied shared logo to `apps/ti-web/public/brand/tournamentinsights_logo.svg`; build root `apps/ti-web`. Env needed: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (optional `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`).
- Styling fixes: TI tournaments cards now use the same sport backgrounds/textures as RI, with `bg-sport-*` classes and copied textures under `apps/ti-web/public/textures/`.
- UI polish: Sport icon moved to bottom-center of TI cards; official/Details buttons centered with spacing to mirror RI layout.
- Filters/summary: TI tournaments filter bar uses RI-style Apply/Reset buttons; summary grid shows total tournaments and per-sport counts with sport icons (mirroring RI summary cards).
- Buttons: Card footers are bottom-aligned; both buttons are white; when official site is missing, the button still renders with a small “TBD” beneath the label.
- Header theme: TI header uses navy → electric blue gradient (`--ti-header-1/2/3`), white nav with blue hover, and yellow CTA (`--ti-cta`/`--ti-cta-text`), matching RI layout/behavior.
- Detail hero: TI tournament detail uses sport-based hero background; centered content; venue block with map links if address present; Google/Apple/Waze rendered as separate buttons; removed referee text. Official link matches directory styling; source link removed.
- Directory hero: Tournament directory intro panel uses a light TI gradient tint with soft blue border to keep text legible while matching the TI header theme.
- Detail buttons: Official site and map buttons use the white pill styling from directory cards; map buttons are hidden unless a real venue/address with city and state is available.
- Venue row: Detail venue section shows venue name + address with navigation buttons aligned to the right; nav buttons are suppressed when venue/address data is incomplete.
- Linked venues: Detail page now reads `tournament_venues -> venues` and renders all linked venues with address + map buttons; falls back to inline venue/address fields if no links exist.
- Header spacing: TI header now keeps Public Beta pill, nav links, and CTA on the same row for alignment.
- SEO: Added TI-specific metadata defaults (canonical, OG/Twitter), page-specific metadata, sitemap.xml and robots.txt, and JSON-LD (SportsEvent) on tournament detail pages.
- Analytics: Plausible script injected site-wide (configurable via `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN`, default `tournamentinsights.com`).
- Homepage: Added credibility/support band under hero with TI gradient tint and copy “Inspired by real tournament families…” (no referee mentions).
