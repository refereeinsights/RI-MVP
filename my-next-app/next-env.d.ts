The `next-env.d.ts` file is automatically generated by Next.js to provide TypeScript definitions for Next.js features. Since it is typically not manually edited, I will provide the standard content for this file.

Here are the contents for `/my-next-app/my-next-app/next-env.d.ts`:

// This file is automatically generated by Next.js
